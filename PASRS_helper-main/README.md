This is helper for filling PASRS.
Currently it is not working. It will be working very soon.

Currently it only triggers the /savereplay command and then saves it to the clipboard. It is planned to be able to fill the PASRS form automatically.

Next stop is adding google sheet support to save the replays there automagicly. But i might be lazy to do that. I'm not sure. Clipboard speeds up the process a lot.

If you are a person with more experience in js than me, feel free to show me guidance and help me out. I'm not a js developer, so file structure is weird.
